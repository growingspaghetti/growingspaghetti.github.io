Problem 59 "XOR decryption"

<p>Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.</p>
<p>A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.</p>
<p>For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.</p>
<p>Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using p059_cipher.txt, a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.</p>


問 59 「XOR暗号解読」

各文字はそれぞれ一意のコードに割り当てられている.
よく使われる標準としてASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) がある.
ASCIIでは, 大文字A = 65, アスタリスク (*) = 42, 小文字k = 107というふうに割り当てられている.

モダンな暗号化の方法として, テキストファイルの各バイトをASCIIに変換し, 秘密鍵から計算された値とXORを取るという手法がある.
XOR関数の良い点は, 暗号化に用いたのと同じ暗号化鍵でXORを取ると平文を復号できる点である. 65 XOR 42 = 107であり, 107 XOR 42 = 65である.

破られない暗号化のためには, 鍵は平文と同じ長さのランダムなバイト列でなければならない.
ユーザーは暗号文と暗号化鍵を別々の場所に保存する必要がある.
また, もし一方が失われると, 暗号文を復号することは不可能になる.

悲しいかな, この手法はほとんどのユーザーにとって非現実的である.
そこで, 鍵の変わりにパスワードを用いる手法が用いられる.
パスワードが平文より短ければ (よくあることだが), パスワードは鍵として繰り返し用いられる.
この手法では, 安全性を保つために十分長いパスワードを用いる必要があるが, 記憶するためにはある程度短くないといけない.

この問題での課題は簡単になっている.
暗号化鍵は3文字の小文字である.
cipher1.txtは暗号化されたASCIIのコードを含んでいる.
また, 平文はよく用いられる英単語を含んでいる.
この暗号文を復号し, 平文のASCIIでの値の和を求めよ.
